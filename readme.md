# URL Shortner

Built using **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB w/ Atlas**.

If you don't have a **MongoDB Atlas** account please create one and create a cluster and fill out <username> and <password> with the cluster username and password.

Run **npm install** on the correct directory on terminal to install dependencies and devdependencies.

After installing dependencies and devdependencies, run express server with nodemon typing **npm run dev**.

### Approach

After some time of brainstorming, I thought collecting and displaying data along with creating unique letters for short url's. After viewing other people's code and videos I had a sense of an idea of using other tools such as Node.js Express and MongoDB would be a factor in building this project.
